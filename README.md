Image to Pencil Sketch with Python

This is a task 4 of level 1:
A small code that can convert an image to a pencil sketch like image. An image is basically an array of numbers to Python. So we can perform a variety of matrix manipulations to get some very interesting results. This code shows how to reduce an image into a ‘sketch’ outline.
