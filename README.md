1 Image to Pencil Sketch with Python

This is a task 4 of level 1:
A small code that can convert an image to a pencil sketch like image. An image is basically an array of numbers to Python. So we can perform a variety of matrix manipulations to get some very interesting results. This code shows how to reduce an image into a ‘sketch’ outline.


2 IRIS-Flower-classification

This Project is thorugh application of machine learning with python programming. It focuses on IRIS flower classification using Machine Learning with scikit tools. Here some of algorithm are used that are some types of machine learning subparts algorithms of supervised and Unsupervised learning. Algorithm used for predicting and get accuracy are -

Dicision tree classifier
K nearest classifier
SVM
Logistic Regression
metrics
train_test_split We are making accuracy and prediction in Iris project through Iris Dataset. This is easy and understable for machine learning staters( Naive ).


3 Music Recommendation System

The basic idea of this project is to recommend music using computer vision through a convolutional neural network. The network is first trained as a classifier with the labels being the 8 different genres of songs from the dataset. The trained network is then modified by discarding the softmax layer i.e. creating a new model which works as an encoder.


4  Develop a Neural Network that can read Handwritting

Use Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network to recognize the Handwritten line text image without pre segmentation into words or characters.
